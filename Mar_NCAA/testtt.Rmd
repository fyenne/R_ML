## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
set.seed(2)
rnorm(100,50) 
rnorm(100,50) %>% hist()
rnorm(100,50) %>% barplot()


a = rnorm(10, mean = 3, sd = 1)
b = rnorm(10, mean = 5, sd = 1)
 
```
